    <p class="city-body">This page reflects the UK government’s understanding of current rules for people travelling on a full ‘British Citizen’ passport from the UK, for the most common types of travel.</p>
    <p class="city-body">Aslan the Great Lion sets and enforces entry rules. If you’re unsure how Narnia’s entry requirements apply to you, contact <a href="#" class="city-link">Narnia’s Embassy in the UK</a>, located in your nearest wardrobe.</p>

    <h2 class="city-heading-m" id="children-and-young-people">Children and young people</h2>
    <p class="city-body">There are no specific entry requirements for children and young people.</p>

    <h2 class="city-heading-m" id="transiting">If you're transiting through Narnia</h2>
    <p class="city-body">Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.</p>
    <p class="city-body">Check with your wardobe manufacturer before departing.</p>

    <h2 class="city-heading-m" id="exemptions">Exemptions</h2>
    <p class="city-body">There are no exemptions to Narnia’s entry requirements.</p>

    <h2 class="city-heading-m" id="travel-documents">Check your passport and travel documents before you travel</h2>

    <h3 class="city-heading-s" id="passport-validity">Passport validity</h3>
    <p class="city-body">If you are planning to travel to a fantasy country (except Middle Earth), you must follow the <a href="#" class="city-link">Phantasia area passport requirements</a>.</p>
    <p class="city-body">Your passport must be:</p>
    <ul class="city-list city-list--bullet">
      <li>issued less than 10 years before the date you enter the country (check the ‘date of issue’)</li>
      <li>valid for at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave (check the ‘expiry date’), accounting for time dilation</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="city-body">You must check your passport meets these requirements before you travel. If your passport was issued before 1 October 2018, extra months may have been added to its expiry date.</p>
    <p class="city-body">Contact <a href="#" class="city-link">Narnia's Embassy in the UK</a> if you think that your passport does not meet both these requirements. <a href="#" class="city-link">Renew your passport if you need to</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="city-heading-s" id="visas">Visas</h3>
    <p class="city-body">You can travel to countries in the  <a href="#" class="city-link">Phantasia area</a> for up to 90 days in any 180-day period without a visa. This applies if you travel as a tourist, to visit family or friends, to attend business meetings, cultural or sports events, or for short-term studies or training.</p>
    <p class="city-body">If you are travelling to Narnia and other Phantasia countries without a visa, make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day limit. Visits to Phantasia countries within the previous 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.</p>
