      <h2 class="city-heading-m">Using the Child Maintenance Service</h2>
      <h3 class="city-heading-s">If you already have an active case</h3>
      <p class="city-body-m">If you have a case with the same parent you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/child-maintenance-service/change-of-circumstances" class="city-link"> report a change of circumstances </a>instead of making a new arrangement. You can use this service if you want to set up a new arrangement with a different parent.</p>

      <h3 class="city-heading-s">Fees</h3>
      <p class="city-body-m">If you decide to use the Child Maintenance Service the application fee is £20 and cannot be refunded. You’ll need a debit or credit card to pay this. It does not guarantee an arrangement.</p>
      <p class="city-body-m">You will not have to pay the application fee if you:</p>
      <ul class="city-list city-list--bullet">
        <li>are under 19 years old</li>
        <li>have experienced domestic abuse</li>

      <h3 class="city-heading-s">If you’re worried about contacting the other parent</h3>
      <p class="city-body-m">If you decide to use the Child Maintenance Service, we will try to contact the other parent about setting up child maintenance – you do not need to.</p>
      <p class="city-body-m">We will share the following details with the other parent:</p>
      <ul class="city-list city-list--bullet">
        <li>your name</li>
        <li>your child’s name and date of birth</li>
        <li>the number of days your child stays with the parent who will be making payments - the other parent will need to confirm this</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="city-body-m">If you are the parent who will be paying child maintenance, we will also share the following details with the other parent:</p>
      <ul class="city-list city-list--bullet">
        <li>your income information</li>
        <li>whether any additional children are taken into account in the calculation - we will not share identifying details about these children, only how many have been taken into account</li>
