# Computes the diff of `packages/city-frontend/dist` between a provided base reference (branch, tag, commit SHA) and the current HEAD.
# It outputs the resulting diff in the provided output folder

# Usage: `bin/package-diff.sh <base-reference> <output-folder>`

# Default the head branch to the commit SHA when detached
head=$(git branch --show-current | git rev-parse HEAD)
