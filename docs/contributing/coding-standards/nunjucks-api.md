# Component API definition and use

We have chosen as Nunjucks as the templating language for GOV.UK Frontend components. We expose those templates as reusable chunks of code: macros. Developers import macros into their application, call them as per documentation and provide data to its options.

To provide a level of consistency for developers we have standardised option names, their expected input, use and placement. There are exceptions, and if so they are documented accordingly.

The options (arguments) accepted by the component macro are specified in a `[component-name].yaml` file as `params`. Each option should have the following attributes: `name`, `type`, `required`, `description`.

An option can additionally contain `params` that denotes nested items in the option (see [breadcrumbs component](/packages/city-frontend/src/city/components/breadcrumbs/breadcrumbs.yaml#L6)) and `isComponent: true` where the option is another component (see [checkboxes component](/packages/city-frontend/src/city/components/checkboxes/checkboxes.yaml#L10)).

Component macro options are shipped as `macro-options.json` in `packages/city-frontend/dist`.

## Specifying content

When providing _content_ to a macro, say for a label or a button, we accept two options:

- `text` accepts a plain string and is the default way of passing content
- `html` accepts html markup. In the template we will not escape html so it will be rendered. In a scenario where both text and html are set, html option will take precedence over text.

Example:

```njk
{{ cityButton({ text: "Button text" }) }}
```

```njk
{{ cityButton({ html: "Button <span class='bold'>text</span>" }) }}
```

Example of implementing logic in a component template:

```njk
{{ params.html | safe if params.html else params.text }}
```

Example shows that if `html` and `text` options are present, then `html` takes precedence over `text` and we are not escaping it.

## Naming options

We should use **camelCase** for naming options.

If a component depends on another component, we group the options for the dependent component inside an object, where the name of the object is the name of the component using **camelCase** convention. In case of ambiguity we prefix the component name.

Example of a component depending on another component

```njk
{{ cityLabel({
  text: "Label text",
  errorMessage: {
    text: "Error message"
  }
}) }}
```

Example of a component depending on two other components

```njk
{{ cityInput({
  name: "example-input",
  label: {
    text: "Label text"
  },
  errorMessage: {
    text: "Error message"
  }
}) }}
```

## Mimic HTML attribute names

When there is a need to specify html attributes, such as _checked, disabled, id, name_, etc, and they map directly, we use the same option name. We use boolean value to check and render the attribute.

Example:

```njk
{{ cityButton({ disabled: true }) }}
```

```njk
{{ cityCheckbox({ checked: true }) }}
```

## Defining additional HTML attributes

When there is a need to add additional attributes to the component, we accept an **_"attributes"_** object with key : value pairs for each attribute.

You cannot use this to set attributes that are already defined, such as class â€“ use the classes option instead.

Example:

```njk
{{ cityButton({
  attributes: {
    "data-target": "contact-by-text",
    "aria-labelledby": "error-summary-heading-example-1",
    "tabindex": "-1"
  }
}) }}
```

## Specifying multiple items

When a component accepts a _single array of items_ for an output, such as checkboxes or radios, we accept an **_"items"_** array of objects. Table component is an exception is it can contain multiple array for rows, head, footer where there is need to for more specific names.

Example:

```njk
{{ cityCheckbox({
   items: [
   {
      value: "checkbox value",
      text: "Checkbox text"
    },
    {
      value: "checkbox value 2",
      text: "Checkbox text 2"
    }
  ]
}) }}
```

## Use of classes to specify variants

When a component has multiple visual presentations, such default button vs start button, we make use of classes option to differentiate between them.

Default button example:

```njk
{{ cityButton({
  text: "Continue"
}) }}
```

Start button example:

```njk
{{ cityButton({
  text: "Start",
  classes: "city-button--start"
}) }}
```
