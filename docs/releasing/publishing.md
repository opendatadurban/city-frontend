# Before you publish GOV.UK Frontend

Read the docs for [what to do before publishing a release](/docs/releasing/before-publishing-a-release.md) to ensure you are prepared to publish.

See the [documentation on support branches](https://team-playbook.design-system.service.gov.uk/guides/version-control/support-branches/#support-branches) if you need to:

- publish a new release of previous major versions of GOV.UK Frontend
- publish a ‘hotfix’ release of GOV.UK Frontend without including other unreleased changes on the `main` branch

# Publish a new version of GOV.UK Frontend

Developers should pair on releases. When remote working, it can be useful to be on a call together.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before starting to publish, make sure the developer running the commands:
>
> - has [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)
>   on their machine to install the correct version of NodeJS and npm
> - has access to Bitwarden to retreive the credentials for publishing on npm

1. Check out the **main** branch and pull the latest changes.

2. Ensure you're running the version of NodeJS matching [`.nvmrc`](/.nvmrc).

   - If you use NVM, run `nvm use` to set up the right version
   - If you use another management system (like [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)), compare the output of `node --version` and install the right one if necessary

3. Run `npm ci` to make sure you have the exact dependencies installed.

4. Pick a new version number according to the [versioning documentation](/docs/contributing/versioning.md) and apply it by running:

   ```shell
   npm version --no-git-tag-version --workspace city-frontend <NEW VERSION NUMBER>
   ```

   ...where `<NEW VERSION NUMBER>` is the literal number without a 'v' in front of it. This step will update [`city-frontend`'s `package.json`](/packages/city-frontend/package.json) and project [`package-lock.json`](/package-lock.json) files.

   Do not commit the changes.

5. Create and check out a new branch (`release-[version]`)

   ```shell
   git switch -c "release-$(npm run version --silent --workspace city-frontend)"
   ```

6. Update the [`CHANGELOG.md`](/CHANGELOG.md) by:

   - changing the 'Unreleased' heading to the new version number and release type. For example, '3.11.0 (Feature release)'
   - adding a new 'Unreleased' heading above the new version number and release type, so users will know where to add PRs to the changelog
   - if the changelog has headings from [pre-releases](/docs/releasing/publishing-a-pre-release.md#publish-a-new-version-of-city-frontend), regroup the content under those headings in a single block
   - saving your changes

7. Run `npm run build-release` to:

   - build GOV.UK Frontend into [the package's `/dist`](/packages/city-frontend/dist) and [root `/dist`](/dist) directories
   - commit the changes
   - push a branch to GitHub

   You will now be prompted to continue or cancel. Check the details and enter `y` to continue. If something does not look right, press `N` to cancel the build and creation of the branch on GitHub.

8. Create a pull request and copy the changelog text.
   When reviewing the PR, check that the version numbers have been updated and that the compiled assets use this version number.

9. Once a reviewer approves the pull request, merge it to **main**.

## Publish a release to npm

1. Check out the **main** branch and pull the latest changes.

   If there was an interruption between the raising of the PR and its merge,
   or it's another developer running the publication to npm, rebuild the package with:

   ```shell
   npm run build:package
   ```

2. Sign in to npm (`npm login`), using the credentials for the **city-patterns-and-tools** npm user from Bitwarden.

3. Run `npm run publish-release`, which will prompt you to check whether the npm tag looks as expected.

   If you're following these instructions, you're probably doing a sequential release, meaning
   the tag should be 'latest'.

4. Enter `y` to continue. If you think the tag should be different, enter `N` to have the option to set your own npm tag.

5. You will now be prompted to continue or cancel the release. Check the details and enter `y` to continue. If something does not look right, press `N` to cancel the release.

   This step will create a ZIP file containing the release in the root of your city-frontend git directory. You will need this file when creating the GitHub release.

   This step will also automatically create a tag in Github which you can use to create a Github release in the following section.

6. Verify the presence of the release and its tag on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/city-frontend?activeTab=versions)

   If the release has been assigned the wrong tag (mistakes happen),
   you can use [`npm dist-tag`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-dist-tag) to quickly correct.

7. Have a quick look at the diff of the new package with the previous one at:

   ```txt
   https://diff.intrinsic.com/city-frontend/<PREVIOUS_VERSION_NUMBER>/<RELEASED_VERSION_NUMBER>
   ```

8. Run `npm logout` to log out from npm in the command line. If you've logged in through your browser, remember to log out from <https://npmjs.com> there as well.

## Create a release on Github

To create a new GitHub release, do the following:

1. Select the tag corresponding to the release in [the list of tags on GitHub](https://github.com/alphagov/city-frontend/tags)
2. Press **Create release from tag**
3. Set 'GOV.UK Frontend v[version]' as the title
4. Add release notes from [`CHANGELOG.md`](/CHANGELOG.md)
5. Attach as release binary the ZIP file that has been generated at the root of this project during the npm publishing phase
6. Publish release

# After you publish the new release

Read the docs for [what to do after publishing a release](/docs/releasing/after-publishing-a-release.md).
